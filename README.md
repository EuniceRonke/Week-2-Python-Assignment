Description
This Python program demonstrates basic list operations, including appending, inserting, extending, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

Steps Performed
Create an empty list called my_list.

Append the values 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Insert the value 15 at the second position (index 1).

Extend the list by adding elements from another list: [50, 60, 70].

Remove the last element from the list using .pop().

Sort the list in ascending order using .sort().

Find the index position of the value 30 using .index() and print it.
